###About Me
I am a macromolecular crystallographer specialising in the structural characterisation of membrane proteins from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic species. Formerly a research fellow at the Biomolecular Sciences Research Complex at the University of St Andrews, I will be shortly taking up a postdoctoral research position at the [Structural Genomics Consortium](http://www.thesgc.org) at the University of Oxford. 

I am the creator of [RubyPrimer](http://rubyprimer.herokuapp.com]): a web application that enables users to easily design hundreds of site-directed mutagenesis experiments with just a few mouse clicks. I am also the lead developer of DNAnode: an ORM wrapper for related nucleic acid sequences written in Ruby. 

I maintain an occasional [blog](/blog) where I write about structural biology, critical thinking and personal development. 

I can be contacted via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/DrSimonBushell) or by email at srbushell at gmail dot com.
