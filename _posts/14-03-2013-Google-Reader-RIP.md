Like many netizens, I awoke this morning to the news that Google will be [shutting down](http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/03/google-announces-readers-imminent-demise/) its Google Reader service from the middle of the year. 

To some extent, this is the way of things: once mighty internet institutions gradually erode away until the cost of maintaining them outweighs the benefits. Geocities, ICQ, MySpace, Usenet: all formerly ubiquitous technologies that are now either gone, re-purposed or re-engineered into something unrecognisible. 

But with the end of Google Reader, something feels different. 

Many have declared Reader's end a symptom of the much-wider [death of RSS](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/rip-google-reader/). The [glee](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/google-readers-death-is-proof-that-rss-always-suffered-from-lack-of-consumer-appeal/) with which some commentators have greeted its demise is baffling. How one can feel triumphant over the death of a standard that has lasted well over a decade is beyond me. 

But with the death of RSS, the web will lose something more important than a simple XML standard: blog loyalty. 

This morning I looked through the list of feeds in my Reader account with a feeling of wistful nostalgia. I imported my feeds *en masse* to Google Reader in around 2006 from whatever reader I was using at the time (NetNewsWire maybe?), so many of the feeds I have there predate Google Reader's genesis in 2005. Among the saved [PubMed](www.pubmed.org) searches and [Metafilter](www.metafilter.com) tag feeds is the long-defunct blog of a girl I had a crush on in about 2006. 

She was an incredibly funny writer from the town I grew up in Australia. I devoured her humourous take on the otherwise mundane and eagerly awaited her next post. She would only post occasionally, with her blog standing silent for months at a time: an eternity in the millisecond attention-spans demanded by social media today. She earned a spot in my Reader account to ensure I wouldn't miss a post. 

She was someone who would never hit Buzzfeed or Reddit, yet she had a small and loyal audience. The news about the end of Google Reader, and RSS feeds in general, remind us how different things are today, and how scary the future of blog loyalty appears to be. 

The general consensus seems to be that social media has replaced syndication, with people sharing interesting articles they find via Twitter and Facebook. 

What a frightening prospect. 

Blogs are now reduced to nothing more than the sum of their parts: a string of atomised entries, severed of the context with which they re-enforce each other.  A diligent blogger might still write regular posts, but with the bulk of his audience now hitting and fading when the occasional entry goes viral on Reddit. Sure, one might find a blogger they like and follow them on Twitter to keep abreast of their content, only to have their tweets drowned out by the doggerel of their contemporaries. 

Equating a blog's success with how many times it is shared on social media stifles creativity and encourages an echo-chamber of groupthink. Whereas once the blogosphere abounded with dissent, creativity and insight, now it pings with Top 10 lists and LOLcats: a reboot of the [Eternal September](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September). 

Bloggers were the last buttress against this decline, and now they are forced to play by the same rules as a 12 year old boy who retweets the umpteeth permutation of the [Harlem Shake](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/harlem-shake) to get their work seen. Cultivating an online presence and generating content used to take time and thought, now it is done with the click of a 'Like' button. 

So please Google, for the sake of good Web content and the futute of the techno-utopia, please reconsider. 

Make a stand. 

Don't be evil.
