title: NDM Twitter Guest Scientist
---

Hello [@NDMScience](http://twitter.com/ndmscience) followers! I am excited to be your guest scientist this week. It's going to be a lot of fun. My name is Simon Bushell, and I am a postdoc in the [Structural Genomics Consortium](http://thesgc.org): a public-private collaborative research institute here in the Nuffield Department of Medicine. 

I am a structural biologist. Here at the SGC we use X-ray crystallography to study the 3D structures of proteins. Proteins are the molecular machines that drive the cell's chemical biology. Everything a living cell does, from breaking down nutrients to replicating DNA, is assisted by proteins. Virtually every protein has a unique structure that is critically important in helping it perform its role. Structural deformities in proteins form the basis of many disases, including cancers and genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis. By studying the structure of proteins, scientists can understand how they function and, if they are the basis of a disease, design drug molecules to effect a treatment

2014 has also been designated by UNESCO as the [International Year of Crystallography](http://www.iycr2014.org/). It's our year! 

This week is an exciting time here at the SGC. Several of my colleagues are currently making there way to California to use the shiny new [LCLS Light Source](https://portal.slac.stanford.edu/sites/lcls_public/Pages/Default.aspx) at Stanford. This new technology has the potential to revolutionise how scientist's use crystallography to solve protein structures, and we are waiting with baited breath to see what insights we can gain using this new technology.

Throughout the week I will be tweeting about my research, interesting developments in science and what we get up to in the lab. Beware: there might be selfies! Feel free to tweet a hello or a question to [@NDMScience](http://twitter.com/NDMScience) this week, or anytime at my own Twitter account at [@DrSimonBushell](http://www.twitter.com/DrSimonBushell).
