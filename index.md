###About Me
I am a macromolecular crystallographer specialising in the structural characterisation of membrane proteins from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. 

I currently work as a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at the [Structural Genomics Consortium](http://www.thesgc.org) at the University of Oxford. Before that, I was a Research Fellow at the [Biomedical Sciences Research Complex](http://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/bsrc/) at the University of St Andrews. 

I am the creator of [RubyPrimer](http://rubyprimer.herokuapp.com): a web application that enables users to easily design hundreds of site-directed mutagenesis experiments with just a few mouse clicks. 

I maintain an occasional [blog](/blog) where I write about structural biology, critical thinking and personal development. 

I can be contacted via [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/DrSimonBushell) or by email at srbushell at gmail dot com
