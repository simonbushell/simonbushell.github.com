Hi Buzzfeed Creationist #4,

I bet its been a crazy 24 hours for you! Not only were you one of the lucky scamps who got to see Ken Ham and Bill Nye duke it out in their creationism vs evolution debate, but you also appear to be popping up all over the interwebs thanks to a recent Buzzfeed post called [22 Messages From Creationists To People Who Believe In Evolution](http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/messages-from-creationists-to-people-who-believe-in-evolutio). 

Let me introduce myself. My name is Simon, and I am a scientist. I also 'believe' in evolution: insofar as I agree that the balance of evidence overwhelmingly suggests that species are not immutable and that natural selection will favour the spread of adventageous genetic traits thorughout a population leading to their change over time. By extension this also means that I 'believe' that life arose on this planet from non-biological chemical origins. 

In my spare time I do a lot of public engagement work and science advocacy. It is because of my passion for science and critical thinking that I am writing to you. I am also Australian, so I kinda sound a bit like Ken Ham too. 

Anyway. Let me answer your question, and then let me explain why I chose you out of the 22 to speak to. 

You asked: "Does not the 2nd Law of Thermodynamics disprove Evolution?"

The answer is no, it doesn't. 

The 2nd law states that the entropy of a *closed system* never decreases, but will evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium or a state of maximum entropy. 

There are a lot of scientific terms in there. But what it basically means is that things like heat and energy tend towards disorder over time. It's like when you pour water onto the ground. Rather than hold the shape of whatever container it was held in before, the water speads out and forms a puddle. When we do this we could say that the resultant puddle has attained maximum entropy. 

So far, so good right? 

Creationists argue that this contradicts the entire premise of life becoming more complex over time. Or, indeed, how life begun on Earth in the first place. If the universe tends towards maximum entropy, how can something as complex as a cell arise? Or indeed, multicellular organisms like you and me? 

This is a common misconception of what the 2nd Law is actually saying. Remember the law states that the entropy of a **closed system** never decreases. Creationists who cite this argument incorrectly assume that the Earth is a closed system. It isn't. All of the heat and energy that the Earth uses for its chemical and biological processes comes from the Sun. It is therefore more correct to think of the Earth and Sun combined as a closed system rather than just the Earth alone. 

Like everything else in the universe, the nuclear fusion reaction that fuels the sun's energy is subject to the 2nd law of thermodynamics. This means that, by definition, the sun's entropy is increasing. One day the sun will run out of hydrogen and burn out to achieve its own entropic maximum. 

The thing is, the decrease of entropy that is associated with the origin and evolution of life on Earth is many orders of magnitude smaller than the increasing entropy caused by the sun burning through its fuel. Thus the 2nd law isn't violated: the entropy of the closed Earth-Sun system is constantly increasing and will one day reach thermodynamic equilibrium. 

Now here's where we need to get honest with each other Creationist #4. 

Most creationist advocates know this. 

Ken Ham knows it too. In fact he [specifically advises](http://www.answersingenesis.org/get-answers/topic/arguments-we-dont-use) creationists not to cite the 2nd Law when arguing with evolutionists. 

So why is the argument that the 2nd law of thermodynamics disproves evolution still thrown about? 

The reason is because its a tough concept for scientists to explain the the public. I mean look at this article. It took me several hundred words to explain it to you.  Trust me, it is as painful for me to write it as it is for you to read it. All you had to do was say "The 2nd law disproves evolution" and then sit back and wait for me to throw out phrases like entropy, closed systems and thermodynamic equilibrium. 

Doesn't that strike you as a little dishonest? Employing an argument that you **know** is completely and demonstrably incorrect? In fact, what does it say about the creationist opinion of the general public? That they aren't smart enough to question such an argument? 

You see Buzzfeed Creationist #4, unlike creationists who employ sophistry and PR gurus to get their message across, I think you're a smart guy. You stood in line to get tickets to the sell-out debate and you braved the terrible weather on the night to see two intelligent guys have a debate on a controversial topic. 

Deep down I believe that the vast majority of people are sensible people who can be reasoned with. In fact, I think Buzzfeed did a pretty shitty thing to you and your placard-writing contemporaries. We science advocates often need to show more patience and understanding to the lay public. I don't know how set you are in your pre-conceptions of evolution. But I would like to think that the fact you showed such dedication to scientific discourse means that you might be open minded enough to read this letter and think about what I have just written. 

Please feel free to drop me a line anytime. 

Kind regards

Simon

PS - If you see Creationist #22 around. Tell him the answer is 'divergent evolution'
